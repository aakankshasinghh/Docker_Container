# Difference in Docker and VM is between the layer they virtualize.
   The main difference is that Docker containers virtualize at the application level by sharing the host OS kernel, 
    while VMs virtualize at the hardware level, running a full guest OS. As a result, containers are lightweight, start in seconds, and are ideal for microservices 
     and DevOps automation.
   VMs are heavier, take minutes to boot, but provide stronger isolation and are better for running multiple OS types on the same hardware
