#Hpw to achieve persistent storage in docker.

Docker images are immutable and don’t change once built.
Persistence in Docker usually refers to data created by containers. By default, when a container is removed, its data is lost. 
To make data persistent, we use Docker volumes or bind mounts, which store data outside the container’s writable layer. 
This way, data remains intact across container restarts or upgrades.
If we want to persist application changes, we can also commit a container into a new image, though volumes are the best practice for data persistence
